  <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
  <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
    <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
    Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
    We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more.

    HTML was created by the original "web developer" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It is not true that Sir Tim invented HTML to share pictures of his cat, but it would be really cool if it was true.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    learn Enough to be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the <a href="https://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the,<a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>. This page is part of the sample site for <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <strong>HTML</strong>, the universal language of the World Wide Web. Other related tutorials can be found at <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">learnenough.com</a>
  </p>
  <h2>Founders</h2>
  <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
    Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
    sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
    <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

    Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
    Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
    <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
    introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
    <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
    plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
    are slightly exaggerated.

   When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
   on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
   interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
   interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

   You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
   Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
   at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
   tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.

  I am a nerd at heart who has always had a love for coding but has never had the opportunity to express my love for code. 2020 is the first year that I finally have a chance to become a developer and change my life forever. The Learn Enough Platform is the first stepping stone to help me achieve that dream
